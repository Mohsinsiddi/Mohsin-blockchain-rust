# Mohsin Blockchain

Welcome to the Mohsin Blockchain project! This project is a simple blockchain implementation written in Rust.

## Prerequisites

Before running the blockchain, ensure you have Rust and Cargo installed. You can install them by following these steps:

### Install Rust and Cargo

1. **Install Rust**:

   - Go to the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
   - Follow the instructions to install Rust using `rustup`.

   Alternatively, you can run the following command in your terminal:

   ```sh
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
````

2. **Verify Installation**:
   - Ensure Rust and Cargo are installed correctly by checking their versions:
     ```sh
     rustc --version
     cargo --version
     ```

## Running the Blockchain

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Mohsinsiddi/Mohsin-blockchain-rust.git
   cd Mohsin-blockchain-rust
   ```

2. **Build and Run the Blockchain**:

   ```sh
   cargo clean && cargo build
   RUST_LOG=info cargo run
   ```

   This will start the blockchain server on port 3030.

## Testing the Blockchain

You can use `curl` to interact with the blockchain. Below are the commands to test various features.

### 1. Generate a New Address

```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:3030/new_address
```

### 2. Check Balance of an Address

Replace `ADDRESS` with the actual address you want to check.

```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:3030/balance/ADDRESS
```

### 3. Add a Transaction

Replace `SENDER_ADDRESS`, `RECIPIENT_ADDRESS`, and `AMOUNT` with the relevant values.

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:3030/transaction \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"id": "TX_ID", "sender": "SENDER_ADDRESS", "recipient": "RECIPIENT_ADDRESS", "amount": AMOUNT}'
```

### 4. Transfer Tokens

Replace `FROM_ADDRESS`, `TO_ADDRESS`, and `AMOUNT` with the relevant values.

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:3030/transfer \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"from": "FROM_ADDRESS", "to": "TO_ADDRESS", "amount": AMOUNT}'
```

### 5. Get Transaction Details by ID

Replace `TRANSACTION_ID` with the ID of the transaction you want to retrieve.

```sh
curl -X GET http://localhost:3030/transaction/TRANSACTION_ID
```

Make sure to replace placeholders like `ADDRESS`, `SENDER_ADDRESS`, `RECIPIENT_ADDRESS`, `AMOUNT`, `TX_ID`, and `TRANSACTION_ID` with actual values when testing.

This README provides clear instructions and `curl` commands that users can easily copy and paste to interact with your blockchain service.
